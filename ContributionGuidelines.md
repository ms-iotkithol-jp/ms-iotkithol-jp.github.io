# Contribution Guidelines

___

### Coding Guidelines:

1. Top Level API consistency
1. Unit Testing Guidelines
1. Check all the return codes
1. Functions have a single purpose
1. Verbose naming of variables and functions

___

### Style Guidelines:

1. Follow the style of the document you are editing

___

### Git Guidelines:

1. Must be auto-mergable.
    * You should have done the work so that we can automatically merge your changes with the current state of the repository. Otherwise we will reject your pull-request and wait until you have fixed it.
1. Never have duplicate commits

___

### What kinds of contributions are accepted?:

* Everything related to the Windows Developer Program for IoT effort. We will not be rejecting pull-requests just because they are not on our list of priorities.
* We will provide a list of our top priorities at the time, including a list of things we are currently working on (to prevent community engagement overlap).
    * You can choose to implement some of what is in this backlog and submit a pull-request or you can choose to do other things not on our list. 

### Review Process:

* Will be the same across the board, both internally and externally.
* Everyone can review a pull request, but only the maintainers can merge the pull request.
    * This way people can get feedback on pull-requests without the maintainers necessarily having to do the heavy lifting. The maintainers will still be doing a final review before any merge.
* We will be working in a 4 week cadence with a pull from the develop branch every 4 weeks.
